# Image Captioning with RNN

In this project, I implemented an image captioning model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The goal of this project is to generate appropriate captions for images by understanding their content and relationships between objects in the scene. Image captioning is a combination of computer vision and natural language processing, and this project uses deep learning techniques to generate captions for images automatically.

### Project Overview
The project uses the COCO dataset (2014 version), which contains 80,000 training images and 40,000 validation images. Each image is paired with a textual caption, and the task is to generate captions for unseen images. This model uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to generate textual descriptions word by word.

### Model Components
1. **Image Feature Extraction**: The model extracts features from images using a CNN model (such as ResNet).
2. **RNN for Caption Generation**: The features extracted by the CNN are then fed into an RNN model, which generates a sequence of words to form a caption.
3. **Word Embedding**: Words are embedded into a multi-dimensional vector space, allowing the model to better understand semantic relationships between words.
4. **Loss Calculation**: The model uses the Softmax loss to calculate the error for each word prediction in the sequence.

### Tasks
The main tasks in this project were:
1. **Forward Step in RNN**: Implementing the forward step that processes the input sequence one step at a time.
2. **Backward Step in RNN**: Implementing the backward step for backpropagation through time to update the model parameters.
3. **Word Embedding**: Implementing the word embedding function to represent words in a vector space.
4. **Loss Calculation**: Implementing the Softmax loss function to compute the model's prediction error over the entire sequence.
5. **Captioning RNN Class**: Combining all the components into a Captioning RNN class that generates captions for images.

### Dataset
The project uses the **COCO 2014** dataset, which contains paired image-text data. The images are pre-processed and stored in a way that allows easy access for training the model. The text data is tokenized, and each word is mapped to a unique integer ID for processing.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is pre-processed to convert images into numerical features and text captions into tokenized sequences.
2. **Model Training**: The RNN model is trained on the dataset to generate captions for the images.
3. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated on a test set to generate captions and assess the quality of the generated captions.

### Final Results
The trained model is capable of generating captions for unseen images, demonstrating the power of RNNs in understanding and describing visual content.

This project helped me dive deeper into the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, exploring how RNNs can be used to generate descriptive text for images.
